Screencasts of our lectures, livecode, and our class notes^[A `@ucdavis.edu` email/class registration is required to access the google doc] are available below. We are using Google hangouts and screensharing, so bear with us on transitions during lecture and live-coding. In addition, there are a number of great presentations that have been recorded at [Davis R-Users Group](http://d-rug.github.io/) meetings, see the Resources tab.
