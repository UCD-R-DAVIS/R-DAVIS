title: "RStudio and Git"
---

Once we've setup R/RStudio, and installed git, the next step is seeing whether we can connect RStudio with Git. Please try this at home before class, and then we'll go through it when we meet.

**This lesson assumes you have:**

 >  - registered for your free Github account
 >  - installed **R**, **RStudio**, and **git**
 >  - Filled out our google form and accepted your invitation to the repository in our [`GGE-R-DAVIS` group](https://github.com/gge-ucd)

This lesson is to demonstrate the basics of using git with RStudio, and should provide a basic understanding of why we want to use version control where possible. 

## Introduction to Version Control

At some point many of us have probably had files in a directory that may have looked like this (*[from PHDcomics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1323)*):

Version control gives you a better way to track changes for things like data files and code, and in a more manageable way. That’s important because when the reviews come back on your paper and ask you to perform some additional analyses and you open up this directory, it can be pretty difficult to figure out which file you should actually use. At the very least you’ll spend a bunch of extra time figuring it out before you get to work, or at worst you may pick the wrong file and then have to redo all your work after realizing the results weren't the same as in the submitted version of the manuscript. For much more detail on setting git with R (or troubleshooting), see the [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/) website.

### Benefits of Version Control

  - *Track changes on steroids*
    - Tracks every change ever made in groups called commits
    - Every commit stores the full state of all of your files at that time
    - Never lose anything
    - Easily unbreak your code/data/manuscript
    - No more file name changes
    
  - *Collaboration*
    - Work on things simultaneously
    - See what changes others have made
    - Everyone has the most recent version of everything
    

## Connecting RStudio & Github

For our purposes the "*best practice*" (i.e., **easier**) for setting up a new github repository in RStudio is through an RStudio *Project*. First, ideally what we want to do is create a new repository on [Github](https://github.com/), then create a new RStudio Project to **clone** (copy) our repository onto our computer (a local version). See the steps below.

### 1. Create a New Repository on Github

 - Typically, the preferred method is to create a new repository on Github...*however*:
    - *For our class, we are using a Github Classroom, which means we've already created the repository in advance and sent you a link. When you click the link, Github creates a new repository for you, which we as a class can all see and work with!*

### 2. Clone Your Repository to your Computer

You should now have a repository on github. Our class is all housed in the [gge-ucd](https://github.com/gge-ucd) Organization, so your repository should appear there, and it should look something like this:

  - [`https://github.com/gge-ucd/w01-fix-readme-ryanpeek`](https://github.com/gge-ucd/w01-fix-readme-ryanpeek). Take a minute to navigate to your repo online and take a look at your `README.md` file by clicking on it. 
  - **To _`clone`_ your repository** (*copy to your computer*):
      - We're going to stick with using **`HTTPS`:** for now. Look for the big green "*Clone or download*" button. Make sure you select the "**Use HTTPS**" so the top of the box says: **Clone with HTTPS**. 
      - Copy that link (should be something like *`https://github.com/gge-ucd/w01-fix-readme-firstnamelastname.git`*).

### 3. Create a New Version Controlled (`git`) RStudio Project

Now we'll create an RStudio Project and link our Github repository (following [*Section 13.3* of `happygitwithR`](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html#clone-the-new-github-repository-to-your-computer-via-rstudio)).

  - In RStudio, start a new Project: `File > New Project > Version Control > Git`. 
  - In the “**Repository URL**” paste the URL of your new GitHub repository. If you hit **`Tab`**, the *Project directory name* will automagically populate with the exact name of the repository. This is generally preferred so you can keep track of things more easily. If you want to save your github projects or RStudio projects in one place, you can do so by specifying the subdirectory. See the *Nuts & Bolts* notes below for more info.

`r emojifont::emoji("nut_and_bolt")` *__More about github/RStudio projects__: One thing to keep in mind is each github repository should only have **ONE** corresponding Rstudio project file. In addition, you never want to save or move a github repository into another github repository...there are hidden files which track your changes (the version control record), and there's potential for conflict if you try to nest or overwite repos and RStudio projects. Best practice is generally make one folder that is `github` or `Rprojects`, and then each project or repository will have it's own single folder within that general directory.*

  - This new subdirectory that you specified will be all these things:
    - a directory on your computer
    - a local Git repository, linked to a remote GitHub repository
    - an RStudio Project
    - It should contain a `README.md` file with some content that we've created...we'll edit that next.

### 4. Push & Commit Changes to your `README.md`

We'll go over this part in class. If you have `ssh` set up and you created your RStudio project, you've done most of the hard work...what remains is:

 - Test whether we can make changes or **edit** our README on our local `master` branch (copy of the repository on your computer).
 - **`commit`** these changes (make a version control record of your change/s)
 - **`push`** these change back to the `remote` which is the copy of the repository on Github.com.

#### Edit README

In RStudio, open your new project (**`Firstname_Lastname`**). Navigate to the *Files* tab and open the `README.md` file. You can click on it in the window and it will automatically open up.

  - **Edit your README:**
    - Add your name
    - Delete the limerick and other bullets
    - Add 1-2 sentences about what you study or what you hope to study
    - Add an "X" inside the **Edited by student** box

#### Stage & Commit to Git

  - Click on the **Git** tab. When you click on the git tab, you should see the `README.md`, and a `.Rproj` file, and perhaps a few other files. That's ok!
  
  - Click on the small box to the left of the `README.md` to stage the file. Then click the `commit` button. You'll see a new widow, on the upper right you need to type a `commit` message, something simple, short, and descriptive. Then click the `commit` button. You should see a little box with message committed.
  
  - Finally before you close everything, hit the **PUSH** button. This *pushes* the changes to the github repository (you may need to enter your Github username & password once depending on whether you used `https` or `ssh`).
  
  - If you go back to the repository in your browser and refresh the page, you should see the changes you've made. Equally important, any collaborator or instructor can now `pull` those exact changes into a copy of the repo on our computer.

Hopefully that all worked! You can now push and pull from your repository.
