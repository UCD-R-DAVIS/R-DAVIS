The following material will be posted on Github via the Discussion board for the class *Team* (2019 is the **Hippogriffs**). Assignments are designed to reinforce the code/lessons covered that week, and provide students a chance to both practice coding and reviewing code. Assignments were completed via private repositories each student set up (via [Github Classrooms](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms)), and each week students will be randomly assigned another student for a code review. Apologies if there are links that don't work, they may be specifically setup for students enrolled in course.
